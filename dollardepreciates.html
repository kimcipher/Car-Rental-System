                            <p>The recent USD exchange rate against the rupee has prompted many local automakers such as Toyota Indus Motor Company (IMC), Pak Suzuki Motor Company (PSMC), and Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) to reduce their car prices. United Motors has also announced price cuts in all its cars.</p>
							<p>Moreover, the Minister for Industries and Production Syed Murtaza Mehmood while chairing the Auto Industry Development and Export Policy (AIDEP) meeting, said that the local automakers should reduce their car prices as a gradual appreciation in the Pakistani Rupee is seen against the US Dollar. The minister appreciated IMC for its initiative of price cuts, followed by PSMC and HACL.</p>
							<p>United Cars has also decreases the prices of the Cars after Toyota, Suzuki and Honda. The reduction of price of cars started last week when the rupee started appreciated against dollar. United Motors have also decided to pass on this benefit to their customers.</p>
							<p>The dollar price is directly proportional to the car prices in Pakistan. As the dollar rate goes up the more prices of the cars will increase. Dollar is the only thing which affects the automakers and the market.
                            Some Weeks ago, the dollar rate was appreciated, auto companies witnessed a change and as a result the market recorded increase in price. When the dollar rate came down. the customers saw a decrease in price of the cars slightly. It doesn't fit the proportion that to the situation when the car prices was increased. 
                             However it is also been said the prices are decreased similar to when depreciation of dollar came. But that is the main point that the prices are not adjusted the same when the dollar rate become high.</p>
                            <p>The price of United Bravo is decreased to Rs. 1,519,000 compared to Rs. 1,619,000, with a price difference of Rs. 100,000. Likewise, United Alpha has also experienced a price reduction of Rs. 117,000, it has a new price of Rs. 1,769,000 against Rs. 1,886,000.</p>
