							<p>Kenya is a dream destination with an incredible mix of natural wonders. Aside from
                                Kenyas natural parks, wildlife safaris, snowy mountains, endless grasslands, and 
                                gorgeous sandy beaches, Kenya, also has a reputation for traffic being chaotic and
                                roads being full of potholes.</p>
                                <p>
                                    How much of that is true? Do you see yourself driving around Kenya? Should you venture
Kenya traffic or hire a driver to take you around during your visit? Read our expert recommendations
to find out whether you would like to get around Kenya by car.
                                </p>
                                <h2>How Are the Road Conditions in Kenya?</h2>

<p>The primary roads around Nairobi are well-paved, despite some potholes. Tarmac roads outside Nairobi 
can conveniently lead you to your safari destination in Kenya. Road conditions are constantly improving, 
so you may encounter some roadworks along the way.</p>

<p>The further you go from Nairobi, the more likely you will be to encounter more unsurfaced roads. While a 
few unsurfaced roads may be in good condition, most roads in Kenya are notorious for their large potholes,
rocky surfaces and rivers overflowing over them.</p>

<h2>Kenya Road Rules</h2>

<p>Although they do exist, many of the locals do not really follow the traffic rules in Kenya. That, in and 
of itself may entice you to consider alternative means of transportation such as renting a car with a driver.
According to traffic laws in Kenya, the norm is to drive on the left-hand side of the road. However, many 
locals drive on the wrong side of the road whenever they encounter a pothole or an animal in their way.
Please note that foreign-registered vehicles with more than 6 seats are not permitted to enter into Kenyan national 
parks and reserves.</p>

<h2>Kenya Road Hazards</h2>

<p>Road conditions vary widely in Kenya, from flat, smooth highways around Nairobi to bumpy dirt tracks in its national 
parks. Although some unpaved roads may be driven in a 2 wheel drive vehicle, a 4 wheel drive would likely be a safer bet.
Beware of potholes on poor roads, livestock, pedestrians, and cyclists. Acacia thorns are a tire-piercing threat in certain 
rural areas. Certain roads have a reputation for bandits on the lookout so it is a good idea to seek local advice before driving around.
</p>

<h2>What Precautions Can I Take When Driving in Kenya as a Tourist?</h2>

<p>Exploring the country by car can be incredibly rewarding, so here are a few Kenya driving precautions, should you choose to drive round:
<ul>
    <li>Drive below the speed limit (80 km/h or 49 miles/h on the highway, and 50 km/h or 31 miles/h in urban areas). Drive at a maximum speed of 40km/h or 24 miles/h when going off-road</li>
    <li>Watch out for unmarked speed bumps</li>
    <li>Drive defensively</li>
    <li>Avoid driving after dark, especially in high-risk areas</li>
    <li>Make sure to always carry drinking water, some cash, emergency food, a fully-charged phone and, spare fuel just in case</li>
    <li>If Kenyan police officers stop you by the side of the road, remain patient and friendly and show them your documents. Beware that some police officers ask for bribes so ask for an official receipt
    in order to avoid being taken advantage of</li>
</ul>
Gas stations are few and far between outside the capital, and gas prices can creep up to surprisingly high prices in more remote areas and inside national parks. Make sure to stock up and carry spare fuel 
if you are taking long trips and going off-road.</p>


<h2>Driving in Kenya as a Foreign</h2>
<p>Should you choose to bring your own vehicle to drive around Kenya, make sure you have all the paperwork at hand. If you are driving a car or motorbike, you will need:

The vehicles registration papers
Liability insurance
Drivers license: An International Driving Permit (IDP) is not necessary in Kenya (most foreign licenses are accepted)

</p>
<h2>Car Rental in Kenya for Tourist</h2>
<p>If you would like to hire a car in Kenya, make sure you are dealing with a reputable car rental company in Nairobi, Kenya and that the vehicle is in a good state. Remember to ask for insurance while renting a car in Kenya. 
Remember to check the brakes, tires, windscreen wipers and car lights before you leave the car rental company.</p>

<p>If you are an adventurous driver, hiring a sturdy 4 wheel drive can open up relatively inaccessible corners of the country. Kenya is not an ideal place for inexperienced or nervous drivers to get behind the wheel. If this is your 
case, you will probably be more comfortable renting a car with a driver, fortunately, this rarely costs a lot more.</p>

<p>Some car hires companies in Kenya require drivers age to be a minimum of 18 to 22 years old, as well as 2 years of driving experience.
Reputable car rental companies in Kenya may deliver a replacement vehicle should you encounter a major problem with the car you have rented while others may leave you to repair the car and then claim a refund. 
Make sure to enquire about possible breakdowns and company policy in these situations.</p>
